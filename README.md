# Localhost [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/socketry/localhost.svg)](https://travis-ci.com/socketry/localhost)

This gem provides a convenient API for generating per-user self-signed root certificates.

## Motivation

HTTP/2 requires SSL in web browsers. If you want to use HTTP/2 for development (and you should), you need to start using URLs like `https://localhost:8080`. In most cases, this requires adding a self-signed certificate to your certificate store (e.g. Keychain on macOS), and storing the private key for the web-server to use.

I wanted to provide a server-agnostic way of doing this, primarily because I think it makes sense to minimise the amount of junky self-signed keys you add to your certificate store for `localhost`.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'localhost'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install localhost

## Usage

This example shows how to generate a certificate for an SSL secured web server:

```ruby
require 'localhost/authority'

authority = Localhost::Authority.fetch

OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new.tap do |context|
	context.cert = authority.certificate
	context.key = authority.key
end
```
